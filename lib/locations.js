The inhabitants had build an enormous glass-like dome over the captial city, also known as Atlantis. When barbarians sent by the Deviant Lemuria empire attacked Atlantis, King Kamuu opened the magma-pits which were the city's means of heating. This caused a chain reaction which collapsed and sank the continent. A few settlements survived the catastophe. The priests and intellectuals of the city Netheria foresaw the Lemurian attack and fortified their city, and thus it sank intact.</p><p>About 8,000 years ago, a group of homo mermani nomads discovered the ruins of the city of Atlantis. They made the ruins of the human settlements in Atlantis their home and went on to develop a society there, using as much of the material as they could scavenge from the wreckage. These people are thus often referred to as Atlanteans, as it is in the city of Atlantis that their first complex society emerged.</p><p>Atlanteans had little or no contact with their human cousins for millenia. However, the two races began to come into sustained contact, often hostile, beginning in the 20th century. On occasions, Atlanteans have invaded the surface world. Although the current Prince Namor, the Sub-Mariner, was initially hostile to the surface world (and has been at times since), eventually during the Second World War the kingdom of Atlantis also fought in alliance with the Allied Powers against the Axis Powers.

With Dr. Carling kidnapped, Logan locates Chang in Tokyo and learns that his old nemesis Kimora orchestrated the ambush. Before long, Logan tracks down Kimora, silently taking out two perimeter guards while Kimora tortures Dr. Carling. Kimora instantly realizes Logan is near, and the two battle while Kimora cryptically suggests that there is more to him (Kimora) than meets the eye. As the battle turns against Logan, Dr. Carling freed himself and beheaded Kimora from behind.

Kimora, it seems, is an immortal from another plane of existence. Having recovered from his beheading, Kimora kidnapped Dr. Carling and took him back to Kimora's own dimension to build a large-scale version of Dr. Carling's invention, a trans-dimensional gateway that Kimora can use to invade other dimensions. Using Dr. Carling's original trans-dimensional gateway, Logan and Chang are transported to Kimora's world where the foreign environs wreak havoc on Logan's animal-like senses. Logan is attacked and wounded by two shadow creatures but is rescued by Rose Carling, the scientist's daughter and now a warrior. The wounds nearly kill Logan, but his rapid healing saves his life. The threesome then approach Kimora's stronghold and bluff their way through Kimora's army. Once inside, Logan and Rose dispense with Kimora's elite guard, but Rose is kidnapped by the remaining shadow creature. After a brief confrontation with Kimora, Logan realizes the shadow creature intends to kill Rose. Logan goes berserk, savagely knocking the shadow creature unconscious and freeing Rose. Logan then pursues Kimora, tearing through a host of castle guards. Still defiant, Kimora kills Dr. Carling and partially opens the trans-dimensional gateway. Logan again goes berserk and shoves Kimora through the gateway. As Logan regains his senses (and his humanity), he shatters the trans-dimensional power supply, condemning Kimora to live for eternity (as an immortal) stuck between dimensions.

It is called \"the Alley\" by its inhabitants.</p><p>The Morlocks are outcasts and rebels against surface society who named themselves after subterranean creatures found in H. G. Wells's book, The Time Machine. They were founded by Callisto, who discovered the tunnels and moved into them decades ago, shortly after they were abandoned. She enlisted the aid of Caliban in finding other mutants to create a new underground society. Morlocks often raided the surface world, preying on the lower classes so that losses as a result of their activities would not be noticed. They stole furnishings, food, clothing, and the other necessities of life, but sometimes they stole children, too, as many Morlocks are sterile. This raiding was discontinued when Callisto lost her rule to Storm in a fight. Though Storm is not in residence, she is still considered the leader. Callisto was saved from death at the last moment by the Healer. Though she was no longer the official ruler, Callisto usually made sure that law and order was upheld in Morlock society while Storm was gone.</p><p>Most Morlocks are hideous and deformed, yet another reason for them to dwell away from society. When Professor Xavier offered to help resettle them on the surface, they declined because they felt the tunnels were the right place for them. This image of themselves as almost sub-human has psychologically affected most Morlocks who feel frustrated, bitter, and vengeful about their situation. Most of the Morlocks were hunted down and murdered by a group of mutant assassins known as the Marauders during the Mutant Massacre.</p><p>In light of M-Day, A few Morlocks have sought out asylum at the Xavier Institute. The few that remain in the tunnels are under Marrow's protection.</p><h3>District X</h3><p>The rise in Manhattan's mutant population, coupled with racism among normal humans, led to mutants forming their own community in a ghetto established in or around Alphabet City, Manhattan. District X was the official title for the region; however, it was more commonly referred to as Mutant Town. Mutant Town was very similar to, and served much the same purpose as, other minority ghettos in New York City like Chinatown, Harlem, Little Italy or Greenwich Village. Soon the neighborhood was primarily populated by mutants, although some humans lived there as well.</p><p>The neighborhood was poor, overcrowded, and violent, with a high rate of crime, narcotics use, prostitution, burglary, and warring mutant gangs. It was once described as having the \"highest unemployment rate in the United States, the highest rate of illiteracy and the highest severe overcrowding outside of Los Angeles.\"</p><p>Despite the poverty and crime, Homo superior culture thrived here more than anywhere in the world outside of Genosha. Mutant Town quickly became a cultural center and population hub for a disenfranchised minority. There was a range of mutant-owned businesses, clubs, and restaurants, including The Double Helix restaurant, X-Factory clothing, Cafe Des Artistes, Frankie's lounge The Power Plant bar, and Mutatoo tattoo parlor. Mutant bands such as Sentinel Bait, Juggernaut, and Cerebrastorm, along with nightclubs such as Daniel's Inferno, Wildkat Klub, Shakespeare's, and Wannabees created a vibrant, mutant-oriented nightlife. Many mutants used to work at such night-clubs, using their mutant powers or appearances, such as Lara King, Lorelei Travis, or Patricia Hamilton. Mutant artists began to emerge, such as Nemesio Pietri, while mutant fashion designers like Jumbo Carnation became celebrities and mutant clothing line like BuFu were founded.</p><p>When the insane mutant Wanda Maximoff altered the world to create a mutant paradise where Homo Superior ruled, District X was transformed into a rich, exclusively-mutant neighborhood named Mutopia X. Conversely, during the same time, Hell's Kitchen became into a human ghetto called Sapien Town.</p><p>The residents of Mutant Town and of the world suffered the effects of M-Day, and most of them were stripped of their mutant abilities. The majority of the remaining powered mutants were moved to a relocation camp on the grounds of the Xavier Institute. Some former mutants remained in District X, with many, such as Quicksilver and Rictor, suffering from depression and alienation. The district became known as the Middle East Side, and lost many of its distinctive characteristics. It became increasingly depopulated as former mutants sought to live normal lives.</p><p>After the birth of the first mutant since M-Day, the neighborhood was briefly taken over by Arcade, who was working for an ex-Purifier, Taylor. Mutant Town was finally destroyed as a 'back-up' plan by Arcade following his defeat. A series of explosions incinerated much of the neighborhood, with Arcade's force fields preventing fire-fighters from entering the area until the entire district had been destroyed. Later, Valerie Cooper announced that the ruins would be demolished and replaced with suburban housing, and that \"in a few decades, no one will even know that this used to be called Mutant Town.\"</p>",

The Nuwali stocked the Land with Earthly life of the era, most notably dinosaurs; as Earth's flora and fauna changed over succeeding millions of years, they supplemented their preserve with prehistoric mammals and early hominids, or \"Man-Apes.\" When Earth's continents shifted circa 50 million BC, the Nuwali augmented the Land's volcanoes to preserve its tropical status. Following the Nuwali's departure in 200,000 BC, little is known of the Land's history for over a hundred millennia.</p><p>In the 1770's, Captain James Cook became the first human explorer to cross the Antarctic Circle, but apparently neither he nor most subsequent explorers discovered the Savage Land. In the mid-19th century, the Atlanteans relocated to Antarctica, as did Lemurian rebels called the Ancients. Mysterious beings such as Torg and the Ice King also made their home in the region. Vague reports of underground realms and surviving dinosaurs appeared in the work of such authors as Edgar Allan Poe and Jules Verne, suggesting rumors of the Land were spreading. By 1915, human expeditions had discovered \"anti-metal,\" the destructive metal also called Vibranium, in Antarctica, but the greater deposits within the Land remained unknown.

But Zaladane's ambitions resurfaced and, commanding the Savage Land Mutates, she stole magnetic power from the X-Man Polaris and threatened the world before meeting seeming death at the hands of a reformed Magneto. The Savage Land was declared a sovereign kingdom, and although menaced by a string of would-be conquerors - including Apocalypse, the Super-Skrull, Prime Evil, the Warlord, Sauron, Mister Sinister, the High Technician, and A.I.M. - its security was repeatedly restored by Ka-Zar, the X-Men, and other heroes.</p>",

	    "content":"<p>The origins of the clandestine Weapon X Program date back to 1945 when a civilian advisor to the American military named Thorton investigated a liberated concentration camp and discovered the hidden laboratory of the enigmatic geneticist Mister Sinister. Using Sinister's research as the basis for his own work, Thorton, also known simply as the Professor, formed the Weapon Plus Program at the behest of the U.S. government. Absorbing the resources of earlier government projects such as Operation: Rebirth, which was retroactively designated Weapon I, Weapon Plus was dedicated to the creation of super-soldiers. Over the next decade and a half, the Program went through various stages of development. The Weapon II and III Programs used animals as test subjects, while Weapons IV, V, and VI experimented upon various ethnic minorities. Beginning with Weapon VII, superhuman mutants became the preferred test subjects, a trend which continued from Weapon VIII through Weapon IX.</p><p>By the 1960s, the Program had advanced to Weapon X and operated under the auspices of the Central Intelligence Agency. Several mutant operatives were organized as the covert operations unit Team X, including Wolverine, Sabretooth, Maverick, Wraith, Mastodon, and Silver Fox. The members of Team X were implanted with false memories by Psi-Borg, a telepathic ally of the Program, with the ultimate intent of suppressing their true memories and awareness of their abilities to become sleeper agents. Team X members also received age suppression and healing factor treatments based on Wolverine's own mutant nature. By the early 1970s, Team X had been disbanded, but the Weapon X Program continued operations under the cover of a division of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p><p>Over a decade later, the U.S. and Canadian governments were jointly administrating the Weapon X Program, with its Canadian branch in turn jointly operated by Canada's Department K and Department H. In this incarnation, Weapon X oversaw the enhancement of various Canadian government operatives, both human and mutant. One such operative was Wade Wilson, who received an artificial healing factor based on the one possessed by Wolverine. The Program was less than successful as most of the participants suffered from various physical or mental breakdowns and were sent to a special Hospice, where, unknown to the Canadian government, scientist Doctor Killebrew conducted inhumane experiments in his Workshop. Killebrew's activities were disrupted when Wilson, calling himself Deadpool, led a massive breakout, and Canada eventually shut down its Weapon X branch.</p><p>Meanwhile, the U.S. branch of Weapon X came under the direction of the Professor, assisted by Doctor Cornelius, Carol Hines, and the manipulative John Sublime. The Professor chose Wolverine as his first test subject and had him kidnapped and taken to a Canadian facility where he was subjected to a brutal process in which the near-indestructible metal Adamantium was bonded to his skeleton, including his mutant claws. The Professor was surprised at the full extent of Logan's mutant nature, which enabled him to recover from the process far more rapidly than anticipated. Reduced to a quasi-mindless state, Wolverine was sent to slaughter the inhabitants of the small town of Roanoke as a test of his abilities. Wolverine ultimately broke free of the Professor's conditioning and ran amok in the Weapon X compound. In the course of his escape, he slew most of the facility's personnel.</p><p>Logan was subsequently found by Department H's director James Hudson and his wife Heather, who nursed him back to health, and he soon joined the Department as both an espionage agent and, later, a costumed operative. His memories of Weapon X clouded by memory implants and his own horrendous experience, he apparently did not recognize the significance of the term when, either by accident or design, it was used as his codename.</p><h3>Mutant Revolution</3><p>After being freed after the conflict with the Avengers, Cyclops, Magneto, and Magik set up base in the abandoned compound. From here they launched their mutant revolution by liberating unjustly imprisoned mutants and offering them aid with their powers and a place in Cyclops' new team of X-Men. Emma Frost soon joined after being freed by Cyclops and Magneto. Together Cyclops, Emma, Magneto, and Magik founded the New Charles Xavier School for Mutants. They redesigned the compound to equip it with dormitories, cafeteria, and a Danger Room, as well as gathering young mutants and training them to use their powers.</p>",

The Evolutionary's citadel itself is referred to simply as \"Wundagore.\"</p><p>The mountain's abiding aura of fear and mystery began as early as the Sixth Century A.D. That was when the evil sorceress Morgan Le Fey led her followers known as the Cult of Darkholders in summoning the ancient demon Chthon. However, the powerful entity proved to difficult to control, forcing the mystics to mystically bind the demon to the mountain itself, effectively imprisoning it within Wundagore Mountain. Chthon's magic was imbued into the very earth itself, making the mountain's dirt, clay, and trees magical in nature.</p><p>The mountain is birthplace to both Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, the latter of which was unknowingly mystically bonded to Chthon at the moment of her birth. This caused her powers to develop erratically over the years and also gave her natural abilities in witchcraft and the control of magic. Chthon also hoped to use the Scarlet Witch to escape the mountain by using her as a host body someday. Indeed, when she first returned to the mountain as an adult, Chthon possessed her, but she was soon freed by her teammates of the Avengers and her adoptive father Django Maximoff, who once again sealed Chthon inside Wundagore before dying.</p><p>Years later, the High Evolutionary's Wundagore citadel came under attack by the villain Exodus and the Acolytes of Magneto. Exodus declared that the Evolutionary and his New Men were abominations and unnatural mutations, unworthy of the destiny of true mutants such as himself. Bova, who was taking care of Quicksilver's daughter, Luna, called Quicksilver for help. Despite Quicksilver's aid, the Evolutionary knew that Wundagore was soon to fall and offered leadership of the New Men to Quicksilver, who agreed. The New Men relocated to another of the Evolutionary's citadels in New York. Quicksilver was charged with keeping the New Men happy as adventure-seekers, and he led the Knights of Wundagore as a sort of superhero adventure team. As Quicksilver became preoccupied with his personal life, however, several of the New Men believed him to be reneging on his promise.</p><p>Eventually, Exodus and the Acolytes discovered where the Evolutionary was hiding, and sent a strike force to destroy him. The Knights intervened, finding the Evolutionary hiding in his citadel in the Savage Land. After defeating the villains, the Evolutionary revealed that his powers and physiology had been fluctuating widely of late, leaving him physically devolved into an ape. He had created Isotope E, with the help of the New Man Lord Delphis, in hopes to cure himself. Using it, he helped to stabilize himself, and he returned with the New Men to New York. Shortly afterward, the High Evolutionary and Quicksilver led the Knights, allied with the hero team Heroes for Hire, and reclaimed Mount Wundagore.</p>",

Xavier worked with fellow mutation expert, Dr. Karl Lykos, as well as Dr. Moira MacTaggert, and they began discussing the idea of founding a school for mutants. Before recruiting his first students, a mysterious man calling himself \"Cable\" arrived at the mansion. In exchange for teaching him about the present, Cable aided Xavier in equipping the mansion with advanced technology.</p><p>Professor Xavier's first student was the 11-year-old Jean Grey, who had been traumatized when she telepathically experienced the emotions of a dying friend. Later, Xavier met Fred Duncan from F.B.I., who introduced him to a young Scott Summers. Scott soon moved into the mansion and, over the following months, Xavier recruited other students including Bobby Drake, Warren Worthington III and Hank McCoy. Together, they formed the original X-Men.</p><p>More mutants moved into and out of the mansion as the X-Men family grew. The first time the mansion was destroyed, it was during a battle with the Sidri. When the mansion was rebuild, it with upgraded with Shi'ar technology. When Xavier was near-fatally wounded and sent into space to recover with the Shi'ar, he left the care of the school to Magneto. The mansion was later destroyed again, this time by Mr. Sinister. With the mansion left in ruins, the X-Men relocated to Cooterman's Creek in the Outback of Australia.</p><p>Only after Professor X's return from space, and the reuniting of the X-Men was the mansion rebuilt. To upgrade the mansion's technology, Professor X asked Forge to assist. The upgrades included the fitting the Danger Room with hard-light holographic technology, constructing a hangar for a new Blackbird, and updating Cerebro's software. A war room was also added to the subterranean levels.</p><p>After being attacked by Sentinels, the villain White Queen was left in a coma and cared for in the medical bay. When she finally awoke from her coma, she and Banshee decided to convert her Massachusetts Academy into a new \"School for Gifted Youngsters\" and train Generation X. Professor X agreed to pass on the title while his ancestral home was renamed the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning. While the Massachusetts Academy operated as a training facility for younger mutants, the Institute acted as the headquarters of the X-Men.</p><p>Eventually, the villain Xorn formed a new Brotherhood of students and destroyed the mansion. Prior to its destruction, Professor X decided that at the end of the term he would step down as Headmaster and pass the reins onto Jean Grey. Unfortunately, Jean died in the confrontation with Xorn. Professor X left the school to attempt to rebuild Genosha while Cyclops and Emma Frost became co-headmasters and rebuilt the school with a new larger design, using funds from Angel. The student body of the Institute was divided into training squads and assigned an X-Man mentor.</p><p>In the wake of M-Day, only 27 students retained their mutant powers. Many depowered students left immediately. Emma and Cyclops later arranged to have the remaining depowered students evacuated in secret, for their own protection, but the bus they boarded was attacked and the children were murdered by the Purifiers. After similar bombings, Cyclops ordered the closure of of all X-Corp offices globally. All remaining mutants seeking help or shelter were directed to the Institute, and to protect the highest concentration of the world's remaining mutant population, the government placed Sentinels around the mansion piloted by members of the Sentinel Squad ONE. The grounds soon became a make shift concentration camp, and the mutants residing in the camp dubbed themselves 198. The school continued to be attacked by the Marauders, Belasco, Purifiers,[ and finally by Bishop using nanobots to control the Sentinel Squad ONE, destroying the mansion. After the final battle for the Messiah Baby and the near-death of Professor Xavier, the X-Men briefly disbanded, relocated to San Francisco and the mansion ruins were left vacant.</p><p>After Wolverine left Utopia with many of the X-Men, he returned to the ruins of the Xavier Institute to found a new school, Jean Grey School for Higher Learning, in honor of the first student of Professor Xavier. Headed by Wolverine and Kitty Pryde, this new school shares much of the ideological structure of its predecessor and even admitted an alien Brood. The facility was designed by Beast and incorporates Shi'ar engineering, allowing for Danger Room technology to be utilized in any area of the structure. Additionally, the facility is completely self-sufficient, generating its own power and growing its own food.</p>",
